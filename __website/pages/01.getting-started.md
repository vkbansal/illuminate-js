# Illuminate JS

Illuminate is a syntax highlighter, based on the well known [prism.js](http://prismjs.com),
rewritten from the ground up in ES6 to be used with projects like
[markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it),
[gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby), [react](https://facebook.github.io/react/), etc.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save illuminate-js
```

## Usage

Before you can use the highlighter, you will need to add the languages defintions you want to use,
as shown below. This helps in keeping the bundle size down.

```js
import { addLanguage, highlight } from 'illuminate-js';

// for example, if you want to highlight 'javascript'
import { javascript } from 'illuminate-js/lib/languages';

addLanguage('javascript', javascript);

// You can alias it too.
addLanguage('js', javascript);

highlight('Your code goes here', 'js');
```

**Note**: IlluminateJS comes with two themes just to get you started. You can include <code>illuminate-js/themes/[theme].css</code> according to your build config.

The included themes are:

* solarized-light
* tomorrow

You can also use any of the pre-existings PrismJS themes from [here](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/tree/gh-pages/themes) and [here](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes)
